        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            Historically, Asians have been a fairly oppressed population in the US. Examples of this are The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Japanese Internment Camps during WWII. This oppression resurfaced during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, as Asians faced discrimination, violence, and shunning. In additon to that, the media had increased the severity of this issue more.

        <h2>Statistics:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hate crimes agains people of Asian decent have increased by 150% in 2020 alone</li>
            <li>In 2019, there were a reported 7,314 hate crime incidents directed at Asians</li>
            <li>There were over 500 incidents within the first two months of 2021</li>
            <li>Hundreds of reported hate crime cases in the US are physical attacks</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left content animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft" id="two">
        <h2>The Severity:</h2>
        <p>
            Some specific reported cases are more than a simple push or shove. The most extreme incident was a shooting in Atlanta that took the lives of eight people, including six women of Asian decent. Some other incidents include racist remarks like "we have all seen the Chinese eating mice alive" and telling them to "go back to China." Examples of physical violence include reports of being punched in the face and one severe case in Spain where a Chinese American man was beaten into a coma by two men.

        <h2>The Media:</h2>
        <p>
            The media managed to make this already bad situation a lot worse. An example of this is Donald Trump's use of terms like "China Virus" and "Kung-flu". In addition to that, media coverage over the pandemic had caused people to point their blame to everyone of Asian decent, despite the fact that the virus originated in specifically China.

        <h2>What has been done?</h2>
        <p>
            The primary act against all the hate was the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. This is an important step for a few reasons. It basically put down enforcement over COVID related hate crimes on state and federal levels. In additon to that, it made reporting hate crime incidents much easier and allowed for public campaigns against the hate.
        </p>

    <div class="left content animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">
        <h2>What more can be done</h2>
        <p>
            The main things that need to be done are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To not contribute to the hate personally</li>
            <li>To educate people to not generalize based on race</li>
            <li>Encourage public messages on the subject matter</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>
            These simple steps can make a big impact and end up making life safer and easier on people of Asian decent
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>
            To conclude, COVID-19 related hate crimes need to be addressed due to the amount and sesverity of said crimes. In addition to that, the media had ampplified the issue even further. Even though The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act has helped with the issue overall, some more steps can be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of Asians.
