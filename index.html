        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            Historically, Asians have been a fairly oppressed population in the US. Examples of this are The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Japanese Internment Camps during WWII. This oppression resurfaced during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, as Asians faced discrimination, violence, and shunning.

        <h2>Statistics:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hate crimes agains people of Asian decent have increased by 150% in 2020 alone</li>
            <li>In 2019, there were a reported 7,314 hate crime incidents directed at Asians</li>
            <li>There were over 500 incidents within the first two months of 2021</li>

        <h2>The Severity:</h2>
        <p>
            Some specific reported cases are more than a simple push or shove. The most extreme incident was a shooting in Atlanta that took the lives of eight people, including six women of Asian decent. Some other bad incidents include racist remarks like "we have all seen the Chinese eating mice alive" and telling them to "go back to China." Examples of physical violence include reports of being punched in the face and one severe case in Spain where a Chinese American man was beaten into a coma by two men.

        <h2>The Media:</h2>
        <p>
            The media managed to make this already bad situation a lot worse. An example of this is Donald Trump's use of terms like "China Virus" and "Kung-flu". In addition to that, media coverage over the pandemic had caused people to point their blame to everyone of Asian decent, despite the fact that the virus originated in specifically China.
